ROM
------------
NA - gives a potential next address to the CAR
MS - selects whether to load or increment CAR
      000 - Inc, 001 - Load
MC - selects either 0:NA or 1:opcode as the load
	address
IL - enables IR to be loaded if an instruction
	is fetched from RAM
PI - increment the PC
PL - jump the PC by the displacement
TD - selects a temp register to write to while
	performing micro-operations
TA - selects a temp register to write out from
	while performing micro-operations
TB - selects a temp register to write out from
	while performing micro-operations
MB - selects either 0:Bus B from the RF or 1:SB 
	from the IR as output from the DP and
	input to the FU
FS - selects a micro-operation
MD - selects either data from the 0:FU or the
	1:RAM as input to the RF
RW - enables registers in the RF to be written
	to
MM - selects a RAM address from either 
	0:the A bus from the RF or 1:the PC
MW - enables RAM to be written to
RV - resets the V flag
RC - resets the C flag
RN - resets the N flag
RZ - resets the Z flag
FL - allows the flags to be set

RAM
------
DataOut - can be either input to the RF, in
	   which case set MD and RW
	  or be Opcode, DR, SA and SB, in which
	   case set IL and unset RW

-Opcode - serves as new ROM address if MC and
	   CAR load are set
-DR - with SB displaces the PC if PL, also
       selects DR in the RF
-SA - selects SA in the RF
-SB - with DR displaces the PC if PL, also
       selects SB in the RF, also serves as
       input to the FU and RAM if MB
